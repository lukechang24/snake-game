## SPACE SNAKE
A game inspired by the classic nokia phone game "Snake", with power-ups, asteroids, and lasers.

# Instructions:
You maneuver with the arrow keys, and can't move opposite direction of the way you're going.  
Your goal is to eat as many stars as you can while dodging random asteroids. As you eat more  
stars, you are able to shoot down the asteroids for more points using the "s" key. Every once  
in a while, a power-up will spawn, granting you a random effect of infinite ammo, decrease  
movement speed, or stop time, only for 10 seconds.
